/**
 * Models an environment in the extended kernel.
 * On the opposite of the micro-kernel, where environment classes had to be created, this class is self-sufficient.
 * The operational code of the natural action processes is defined in a separate 
 * class. The environment class only stores a reference to this class.
 * <h2>Benefits</h2>
 * This property has a huge benefit: 
 * <ul>
 * 	<li>
 * 		The behavior of the environment can evolve at runtime.
 * 	</li>
 * </ul>
 * <h2>Environment specification</h2>
 * <p>
 * 	The specification of such environments requires one operation:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * 	<li>
 * 		The specification of the levels where the environment lies, using the 
 * 		{@link ExtendedEnvironment#includeNewLevel(LevelIdentifier, IPublicLocalState, IEnvNaturalModel)} method.
 * 	</li>
 * </ul>
 * <h2>Introspection and intercession</h2>
 * <p>
 * 	Environment introspection is achieved with the following methods:
 * 	<ul>
 * 		<li>{@link ExtendedEnvironment#getNaturalActionModel(LevelIdentifier)}</li>
 * 	</ul>
 * <p>
 * 	Environment intercession is achieved with the following methods:
 * 	<ul>
 * 		<li>{@link ExtendedEnvironment#changeNaturalActionModel(LevelIdentifier, IEnvNaturalModel)}</li>
 * 	</ul>
