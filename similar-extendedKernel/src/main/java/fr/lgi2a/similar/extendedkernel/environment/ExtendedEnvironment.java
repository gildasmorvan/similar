/**
 * Models an environment in the extended kernel.
 * <p>
 * 	On the opposite of the micro-kernel, where environment classes had to be created, this class is self-sufficient.
 * 	The operational code of the natural action processes is defined in a separate 
 * 	class. The environment class only stores a reference to this class.
 * </p>
 * <h2>Benefits</h2>
 * This property has a huge benefit: 
 * <ul>
 * 	<li>
 * 		The behavior of the environment can evolve at runtime.
 * 	</li>
 * </ul>
 * <h2>Environment specification</h2>
 * <p>
 * 	The specification of such environments requires two operations:
 * <ul>
 * 	<li>
 * 		The definition of the initial local states of the environment, using the 
 * 		{@link AbstractEnvironment#includeNewLevel(LevelIdentifier, ILocalStateOfEnvironment, ILocalStateOfEnvironment)} method.
 * 	</li>
 * 	<li>
 * 		The specification of the behavior of the environment in each level, using the 
 * 		{@link ExtendedEnvironment#specifyBehaviorForLevel(LevelIdentifier, IEnvNaturalModel)} method.
 * 	</li>
 * </ul>
 * <h2>Introspection and intercession</h2>
 * <p>
 * 	Environment introspection is achieved with the following methods:
 * 	<ul>
 * 		<li>{@link ExtendedEnvironment#getNaturalModelForLevel(LevelIdentifier)}</li>
 * 	</ul>
 * <p>
 * 	Environment intercession is achieved with the following methods:
 * 	<ul>
 * 		<li>{@link ExtendedEnvironment#specifyBehaviorForLevel(LevelIdentifier, IEnvNaturalModel)}</li>
 * 	</ul>
 * </p>
