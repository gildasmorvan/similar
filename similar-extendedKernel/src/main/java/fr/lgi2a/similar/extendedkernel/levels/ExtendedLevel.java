/**
 * Models a level in the extended kernel.
 * <p>
 * 	On the opposite of the micro-kernel, where level classes had to be created, this class is self-sufficient.
 * 	The operational code of the reaction processes and of the time model is defined in a separate 
 * 	class. The level class only stores a reference to this class.
 * </p>
 * <h2>Benefits</h2>
 * This property has a huge benefit: 
 * <ul>
 * 	<li>
 * 		The behavior of the environment can evolve at runtime.
 * 	</li>
 * </ul>
 * <h2>Level specification</h2>
 * 	The specification of such levels requires the following operations 
 * 	during the initialization of the simulation:
 * <ul>
 * 	<li>
 * 		The initialization of the dynamic state of the level, 
 * 		using the following methods:
 * 		<ul>
 * 			<li> {@link fr.lgi2a.similar.microkernel.dynamicstate.IModifiablePublicLocalDynamicState#setPublicLocalStateOfEnvironment(fr.lgi2a.similar.microkernel.environment.ILocalStateOfEnvironment)}</li>
 * 		</ul>
 * 	</li>
 * 	<li>
 * 		The specification of the reaction model of the level, using the 
 * 		{@link ExtendedLevel#setReactionModel(ILevelReactionModel)} method.
 * 	</li>
 * </ul>
 * <h2>Introspection and intercession</h2>
 * <p>
 * 	Level introspection is achieved with the following methods:
 * 	<ul>
 * 		<li>{@link ExtendedLevel#getTimeModel()}</li>
 * 		<li>{@link ExtendedLevel#getReactionModel()}</li>
 * 	</ul>
 * <p>
 * 	Level intercession is achieved with the following methods:
 * 	<ul>
 * 		<li>{@link ExtendedLevel#setReactionModel(ILevelReactionModel)}</li>
 * 	</ul>
