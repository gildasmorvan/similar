	 * Performs a user-defined reaction to the system influences that are lying in the most recent consistent dynamic state of

	 * 		A first time right after the system reaction to the system influences happening at the beginning of the reaction phase.

	 * 		dynamic state of the level during the transitory period (for instance to add an agent to the topology of the environment).
