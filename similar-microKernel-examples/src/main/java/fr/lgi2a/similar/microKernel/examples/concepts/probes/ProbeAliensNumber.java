 * 	A probe is an object observing the dynamic state of the simulation during a consistent (or half-consistent) state
 * 	of the simulation. It processes and displays the data of the simulation. The observation can be made about everything in the simulation:
 * 	public local states, private local states, global memory states, etc.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * 	In the micro-kernel of SIMILAR, a probe is implemented as an 
 * 	instance of the {@link IProbe} interface.
