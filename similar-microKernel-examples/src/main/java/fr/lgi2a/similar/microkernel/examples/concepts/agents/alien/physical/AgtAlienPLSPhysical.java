/**
 * Models the public local state of a 'Alien' agent for the 'physical' level.

 * <h1>Naming convention</h1>
 * In the name of the class:
 * <ul>
 * 	<li>"Agt" stands for "Agent"</li>
 * 	<li>"PLS" stands for "Public Local State"</li>
 * </ul>
 * These rules were defined to reduce the size of the name of the class.
 * 
 * <h1>Public local state of an agent in the SIMILAR API suite.</h1>
 * <p>
 * 	In the micro-kernel of SIMILAR, the public local state of an agent is implemented as an 
 * 	instance of either the {@link fr.lgi2a.similar.microkernel.IPublicLocalStateOfAgent} interface, or of the {@link AbstractPublicLocalStateOfAgent} 
 * 	abstract class.
 * 	In this example, we use the abstract class which is easier to implement.
