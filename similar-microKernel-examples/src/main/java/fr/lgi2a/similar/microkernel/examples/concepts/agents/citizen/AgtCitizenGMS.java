/**
 * Models the global memory state of a 'Citizen' agent.
 * 
 * <h1>Naming convention</h1>
 * In the name of the class:
 * <ul>
 * 	<li>"Agt" stands for "Agent"</li>
 * 	<li>"GMS" stands for "Global Memory State"</li>
 * </ul>
 * These rules were defined to reduce the size of the name of the class.
 * 
 * <h1>Global memory states in the SIMILAR API suite.</h1>
 * <p>
 * 	In the micro-kernel of SIMILAR, the global memory state of an agent is implemented as an 
 * 	instance of either the {@link fr.lgi2a.similar.microkernel.IGlobalMemoryState} interface, or of the {@link AbstractGlobalMemoryState} 
 * 	abstract class.
 * 	In this example, we use the abstract class which is easier to implement.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <h1>Best practices</h1>
 * <p>
 * 	The identification of the data that should be in the global memory state and the data that
 * 	should be in the private local state of the agent is a hard task. Indeed, the simple rule 'if the 
 * 	data is used in more than one level and cannot be perceived, then the data belongs to the global memory state' 
 * 	is not appropriate in the general case:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * 	<li>
 * 		The same data can be used in the bahavior of the agent in different levels using different forms. 
 * 		For instance a the total number of agents (for a level), 
 * 		and the number of agents per category (for the other). In this case, it becomes difficult to tell if the number of agents per category should be
 * 		placed in a global dynamic state and if the total number of agents should be computed using the memorized data, or if the data should
 * 		appear in the private local state of the different levels of the agent.
 * 	</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * 	In the end, it is up to the user to determine the information to include in the global dynamic state. 
 * 	The global memory state can include beliefs as well as plans, or only beliefs or cross level plans, etc.
 * </p>
