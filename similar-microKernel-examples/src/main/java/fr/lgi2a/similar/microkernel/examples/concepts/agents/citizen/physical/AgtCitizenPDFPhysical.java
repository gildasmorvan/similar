/**
 * Models the data being perceived by a 'Citizen' agent when it is perceiving the simulation from the 'Physical' level.
 * 
 * <h1>Naming convention</h1>
 * In the name of the class:
 * <ul>
 * 	<li>"Agt" stands for "Agent"</li>
 * 	<li>"PDF" stands for "Perceived Data From the level"</li>
 * </ul>
 * These rules were defined to reduce the size of the name of the class.
 * 
 * <h1>Perceived data in the SIMILAR API suite.</h1>
 * <p>
 * 	In the micro-kernel of SIMILAR, the data perceived by agent are implemented as an 
 * 	instance of either the {@link fr.lgi2a.similar.microkernel.IPerceivedDataOfAgent} interface or the {@link AbstractPerceivedDataOfAgent} 
 * 	abstract class.
 * 	In this example, we use the abstract class which is easier to implement.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <h1>Best practice</h1>
 * <p>
 * 	It is always possible to include a reference to the public local dynamic state of the perceptible levels
 * 	in the perceived data. Yet, this approach is not advised since it hides the data that are really necessary to build
 * 	the behavior of the agent. Instead, we uphold that this class has to contain as little data as possible. Moreover,
 * 	it can contain interpretations of the data contained in the perceptible levels rather than data directly extracted from 
 * 	that level.
 * 	For instance, if the behavior of the agent changes only depending on the number of other agents in a specific level, the 
 * 	perceived data should only contain the number of agents, and not a reference on the collection of agents lying in that level.
