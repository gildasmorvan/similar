/**
 * A factory method generating 'Editor in chief' agents. Agents are generated using both explicit parameters and default parameters.
 * 
 * <h1>Best practices</h1>
 * <p>
 * 	The generation of agents during simulation implies the specification of the parameters 
 * 	used for their initialization. Yet, giving an explicit value inside the behavior of the agent creating the 
 * 	new agent might not be relevant (for instance, there is no reason that the 'FBI' agent defines explicitly the 'paranoiaThreshold'
 *  private local state of the 'Editor in chief' agent it is creating). To avoid these irrelevances, these parameters can be defined either in 
 *  a default constructor (dirty yet easy method) or with a factory (clean but more complex approach).
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * 	This class illustrates the use of a factory to create agents having some default parameters and some explicit parameters.
