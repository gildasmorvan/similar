 * <h1>Naming convention</h1>
 * In the name of the class:
 * <ul>
 * 	<li>"Env" stands for "Environment"</li>
 * </ul>
 * These rules were defined to reduce the size of the name of the class.
 * 
 * <h1>Environment in the SIMILAR API suite.</h1>
 * <p>
 * 	In the micro-kernel of SIMILAR, the environment is implemented as an 
 * 	instance of either the {@link fr.lgi2a.similar.microkernel.IEnvironment} interface, or of the {@link AbstractEnvironment} 
 * 	abstract class.
 * 	In this example, we use the abstract class which is easier to implement.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <h1>Usage</h1>
 * <p>
 * 	An environment has to define a public local state for each level of the simulation. In the {@link AbstractEnvironment} class, these 
 * 	level are specified using the {@link AbstractEnvironment#includeNewLevel(LevelIdentifier, fr.lgi2a.similar.microkernel.IPublicLocalState)} method.
