/**
 * Models the public local state of the environment for the 'physical' level.
 * 
 * <h1>Naming convention</h1>
 * In the name of the class:
 * <ul>
 * 	<li>"Env" stands for "Environment"</li>
 * 	<li>"PLS" stands for "Public Local State"</li>
 * </ul>
 * These rules were defined to reduce the size of the name of the class.
 * 
 * <h1>Public local state of the environment in the SIMILAR API suite.</h1>
 * <p>
 * 	In the micro-kernel of SIMILAR, the public local state of the environment is implemented as an 
 * 	instance of either the {@link IPublicLocalState} interface, or of the {@link AbstractPublicLocalState} 
 * 	abstract class.
 * 	In this example, we use the abstract class which is easier to implement.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <h1>Usage</h1>
 * <p>
 * 	This public local state stores the association between a location (city) and the agents lying at that position.
 * 	This facilitates the perception process of all the agents.
 * </p>
