/**
 * Models the public local state of the environment for the 'social' level.
 * 
 * <h1>Naming convention</h1>
 * In the name of the class:
 * <ul>
 * 	<li>"Env" stands for "Environment"</li>
 * 	<li>"PLS" stands for "Public Local State"</li>
 * </ul>
 * These rules were defined to reduce the size of the name of the class.
 * 
 * <h1>Public local state of the environment in the SIMILAR API suite.</h1>
 * <p>
 * 	In the micro-kernel of SIMILAR, the public local state of the environment is implemented as an 
 * 	instance of either the {@link fr.lgi2a.similar.microkernel.IPublicLocalState} interface, or of the {@link AbstractPublicLocalState} 
 * 	abstract class.
 * 	In this example, we use the abstract class which is easier to implement.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <h1>Usage</h1>
 * <p>
 * 	This public local state models the media (the Internet and a TV program).
 * 	It contains two types of information:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * 	<li>
 * 		An TV program dedicated to UFO investigation. This program broadcasts the number of 
 * 		strange physical manifestation over which a citizen can consider that an alien experiment 
 * 		was performed on him/her.
 * 	</li>
 * 	<li>
 * 		A blog where citizen can tell that they were abducted by aliens. This blog contains a post (an article) 
 * 		for each report made by a citizen.
 * 	</li>
 * </ul>
