/**
 * Models the influence sent by a 'FBI' agent when it wishes to remove all the posts from the Internet.
 * 
 * <h1>Naming convention</h1>
 * In the name of the class:
 * <ul>
 * 	<li>"RI" stands for "Regular Influence"</li>
 * </ul>
 * These rules were defined to reduce the size of the name of the class.
 * 
 * <h1>Regular influences in the SIMILAR API suite.</h1>
 * <p>
 * 	In the micro-kernel of SIMILAR, the regular influences are implemented as an 
 * 	instance of either the {@link fr.lgi2a.similar.microkernel.IInfluence} interface or the {@link RegularInfluence} 
 * 	abstract class.
 * 	In this example, we use the abstract class which is easier to implement.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <h1>Best practice</h1>
 * <p>
 * 	The category of the influence is a unique identifier for the influence. It is defined to avoid
 * 	using <code>instanceof</code> instructions in the reaction of the level to identify the nature of the
 * 	influence and the operations that have to be performed in reaction to the influence.
