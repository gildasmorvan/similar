	 * <h1>Usage</h1>
	 * <p>
	 * 	This reaction reads the influences contained in the <code>regularInfluencesOftransitoryStateDynamics</code>
	 * 	argument and performs operations into the public local dynamic state of the level (<code>consistentState</code> 
	 * 	argument), or in the public local state of the environment or agents it contains.

	 * <p>
	 * 	The influence can either be consumed by the reaction (they disappear from the simulation) or can persist after the reaction
	 *  (if the influence models an unfinished action when the reaction ends).
	 *  In the second case, the influence has to be included into the <code>remainingInfluences</code> set.
	 * </p>
	 * <p>
	 * 	If the reaction produces other influences, these influences have to be added to the <code>remainingInfluences</code> set.
	 * 	Note that the system influences aimed at levels currently performing their reaction are managed right after the end of the call 
	 * 	to this method. Otherwise, these influences are managed during the next reaction of the level they are aimed at.
	 * </p>
	 * @param previousConsistentStateTime The time stamp of the last time a reaction was computed for this level.
