 * <p>
 * 	The reaction of a level is a process changing the value of the last consistent public local dynamic state of the level from 
 * 	a time stamp to the next time stamp of the level. This process is performed using the following steps:
 * </p>
 * <ol>
 * 	<li>Create a new consistent dynamic state of the level as a copy of the last consistent dynamic state.</li>
 * 	<li>Reset the state dynamics (remove all the influences it contains).</li>
 * 	<li>
 * 		The level asks the engine to perform the reaction to the system influences of contained in the 
 * 		state dynamics of the current transitory state
 *	</li>
 *	<li>
 *		The level then performs a user defined reaction to these system influences, for instance to update the public local state 
 *		of the environment when an influence added / removed the public local state of an agent into that level.
 *	</li>
 *	<li>
 *		If the engine or user reaction did generate new influences: 
 *		<ul>
 *			<li>The regular influences are added to the state dynamics of the current transitory state of the level</i>
 *			<li>The system influences are managed using the step 3 again</i>
 *			<li>
 *				If the influence is targeted at another level:
 *				<ul>
 *					<li>
 *						It is added to the state dynamics of the transitory state of the other level, if the transitory state of the 
 *						other level does not end at the same time than the transitory state of this level, <i>i.e.</i> if no reaction is
 *						currently being performed for that level.
 *					</li>
 *					<li>
 *						It is managed by the current reaction process of the other level otherwise.
 *					</li>
 *				</ul>
 *			</li>
 *		</ul>
 *	</li>
 *	<li>
 *		Then, the level performs a user defined reaction to the regular influences of the state dynamics of the current transitory 
 *		state of the level.
 *		The influences persisting after this reaction have to be added to the state dynamics of the new consistent public local dynamic 
 *		state of the level.

	 * <h2>Usage</h2>
	 * <p>
	 * 	The <code>newConsistentState</code> argument of this method contains a copy of the last consistent state, 
	 * 	where the state dynamics are empty. The reaction has to add to this set all the influences that persist after 
	 * 	reaction. The other influences are consumed by the reaction.
	 * 	Note that this reaction can also produce other influences that might have to be handled either by the current reaction (for 
	 * 	instance the addition of new agents) or by the current/next reaction of other levels. Such influences have to be added to 
	 * 	the <code>newInfluencesToProcess</code> set.
	 * </p>
	 * <p>
	 * 	Note that for time and memory efficiency reasons, the public local state of the agents and of the environment of the new
	 * 	consistent state (<code>newConsistentState</code> argument) are references to the public local state of the agents and of 
	 * 	the environment of the last consistent state (<code>lastConsistentState</code>).
	 * </p>
	 * @param lastConsistentState The consistent state preceding the transitory phase ended by the reaction.
	 * @param newConsistentState The consistent state following the transitory phase ended by the reaction. This state is updated
	 * by the operations performed in this reaction.
	 * @param regularInfluencesOftransitoryStateDynamics The <b>regular</b> influences that have to be managed by this reaction to go from the 
	 * previous consistent state to the next consistent state of the level.
	 * @param newInfluencesToProcess The influences that were produced by this method and 
	 * that have to be handled either by the current reaction of the level (system influences) or handled in other levels 
	 * of the simulation. The regular influences added in the <code>newInfluencesToProcess</code> will be managed during the next reaction
	 * of this level.

	/**
	 * Performs a reaction of the level to specific system influences.
	 * <p>
	 * 	TODO formal notation
	 * </p>
	 * <h2>Usage</h2>
	 * <p>
	 * 	This method is called whenever a system influence has to be managed either because it was present in the transitory 
	 * 	dynamic state, or because the reaction phase added new system influences that have to be managed.
	 * </p>
	 * <p>
	 * 	The system influences contained in the <code>systemInfluencesToManage</code> set were previously managed by the 
	 * 	simulation engine. Thus, this method only contains a level specific behavior (for instance updating the public local state of the
	 * 	environment in response to the apparition/disappearance of the public local state of an agent).
	 * </p>
	 * @param lastConsistentState The consistent state preceding the transitory phase ended by the reaction.
	 * @param newConsistentState The consistent state following the transitory phase ended by the reaction. This state is updated
	 * by the operations performed in this reaction.
	 * @param systemInfluencesToManage The system influences for which a special reaction might be necessary by the level.
	 * @param happensBeforeRegularReaction <code>true</code> if the reaction to the system influence happened before the call to
	 * the {@link I_Level#makeRegularReaction(I_PublicLocalDynamicState, Consistent_PublicLocalDynamicState, Set, Set)} method.
	 * @param newInfluencesToProcess The influences that were produced by this method and 
	 * that have to be handled either by the current reaction of the level (system influences) or handled in other levels 
	 * of the simulation. The regular influences that have to be managed by this level during the next reaction have to be added to the 
	 * state dynamics of the new consistent state. The regular influences that have to be managed by this level during the current reaction
	 * have to be added to this argument only if <code>happensBeforeRegularReaction</code> is <code>true</code>. Otherwise, the 
	 * influence is automatically added to the state dynamics of the new consistent state.
