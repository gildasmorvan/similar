/**
 * The object identifying the category of an agent involved in a simulation.
 * 
 * <h1>Usage</h1>
 * <p>
 * 	To facilitate the access to agent categories, it is recommended to create 
 * 	a class containing each agent category of the simulation as a static value. This avoids
 * 	any misspelling when referring to a level.
 * </p>
 * <h2>Example</h2>
 * <p>
 * 	The following code shows how to create the agent categories for a simulation of the road traffic,
 * 	containing a "Vehicle" and "Pedestrian" agent categories.
 * </p>
<pre>
public class CategoriesOfRoadTrafficSimulation {
	public static final AgentCategory VEHICLE = new AgentCategory( "Vehicle" );
	public static final AgentCategory PEDESTRIAN = new AgentCategory( "Pedestrian" );
}
</pre>
