/**
 * The object identifying one level involved in a simulation.
 * 
 * <h1>Usage</h1>
 * <p>
 * 	To facilitate the access to level identifiers, it is recommended to create 
 * 	a class containing the identifier of each level as a static value. This avoids
 * 	any misspelling when referring to a level.
 * </p>
 * <h2>Example</h2>
 * <p>
 * 	The following code shows how to create the level identifiers for a simulation of the road traffic,
 * 	containing a "Traffic" level where vehicles move in the infrastructure of the road network, and a 
 * 	"GPS" level where the GPS tells vehicles how they can navigate.
 * </p>
<pre>
public class LevelsOfRoadTrafficSimulation {
	public static final LevelIdentifier TRAFFICLEVEL = new LevelIdentifier( "Traffic level" );
	public static final LevelIdentifier GPSLEVEL = new LevelIdentifier( "GPS level" );
}
</pre>
