/**
 * Models a level of the simulation.
 * 
 * <h1>Correspondence with theory</h1>
 * <p>
 * 	An instance of this class models a level l&isin;&#x1D543;
 * </p>
 * 
 * <h1>Usage</h1>
 * <p>
 * 	The reaction of a level is a process changing the value of the last consistent public local dynamic state of the level from 
 * 	a time stamp <code>t<sub>l</sub></code> to the next time stamp of the level <code>t<sub>l</sub>+dt<sub>l</sub></code>. 
 * 	This process relies on the following steps:
 * </p>
 * <ol>
 * 	<li>
 * 		The engine first loops over the system influences located in both the last consistent dynamic state 
 * 		<code>&delta;<sub>l</sub>(t<sub>l</sub>)</code> and the ones located in the transitory dynamic state 
 * 		of the level right before the computation of the reaction.
 * 		During this loop, the engine removes the processed system influences from the both dynamic states.
 * 		This process might add new influences to the simulation (for instance the 'add agent to simulation' influence
 * 		produces 'add public local state of agent to level' influences).
 * 		In such a case, if at least one added influence is a system influence, the engine performs another loop to manage them.
 *	</li>
 *	<li>
 *		Once all the system influences are processed, the engine performs a user-defined reaction to the system influences, as described 
 *		by the {@link ILevel#makeSystemReaction(SimulationTimeStamp, SimulationTimeStamp, ConsistentPublicLocalDynamicState, Collection, boolean, InfluencesMap)}
 *		method.
 *		This user-defined reaction:
 * 		<ul>
 * 			<li>
 * 				Updates the public local state of the environment and of the agents contained in the last consistent dynamic state, 
 * 				according to the modifications depicted by the regular influences.
 * 				This operation is part of the transformation of the last consistent dynamic state 
 * 				<code>&delta;<sub>l</sub>(t<sub>l</sub>)</code> into the new last consistent dynamic state 
 * 				<code>&delta;<sub>l</sub>(t<sub>l</sub> + dt<sub>l</sub>)</code>.
 * 
 *  			For instance, if the public local state of the environment defines an agent grid, this method can add the 
 *  			public local state of an agent to the grid, in reaction to the 'add public local state of agent to level' 
 *  			system influence.
 *  		</li>
 *  		<li>
 *  			Can produce new influences (for instance the addition of an agent to the simulation).
 *  			The system influences added in such a way will be processed either during the next reaction of the level 
 *  			they are aimed at (if the targeted level is not currently computing its reaction), or during the current 
 *  			reaction (in the next steps of this process).
 *  		</li>
 * 		</ul>
 *	</li>
 *	<li>
 *		The engine then performs a user-defined reaction to the regular influences, as described by the 
 *		{@link ILevel#makeRegularReaction(SimulationTimeStamp, SimulationTimeStamp, ConsistentPublicLocalDynamicState, Set, InfluencesMap)}
 *		method.
 *		This user-defined reaction:
 *		<ul>
 * 			<li>
 * 				Updates the public local state of the environment and of the agents contained in the last consistent dynamic state, 
 * 				according to the modifications depicted by the regular influences.
 * 				This operation is part of the transformation of the last consistent dynamic state 
 * 				<code>&delta;<sub>l</sub>(t<sub>l</sub>)</code> into the new last consistent dynamic state 
 * 				<code>&delta;<sub>l</sub>(t<sub>l</sub> + dt<sub>l</sub>)</code>.
 *  		</li>
 *  		<li>
 *  			Determines which regular influences do persist after the reaction and which ones are consumed by the 
 *  			reaction (and are thus not retained in the new last consistent dynamic state).
 *  		</li>
 *  		<li>
 *  			Can produce new influences (for instance the addition of an agent to the simulation).
 *  			The influences added in such a way will be processed either during the next reaction of the level 
 *  			they are aimed at (if the targeted level is not currently computing its reaction or if the influence is a 
 *  			regular influence), or during the current reaction (in the next steps of this process).
 *  		</li>
 *		</ul>
 *	</li>
 * 	<li>
 * 		The engine then loops again over the system influences that were added by the user-defined reactions into the levels that
 * 		are computing a reaction.
 * 		During this loop, the engine removes the processed system influences from the both dynamic states.
 * 		This process might add new influences to the simulation (for instance the 'add agent to simulation' influence
 * 		produces 'add public local state of agent to level' influences).
 * 		In such a case, if at least one added influence is a system influence, the engine performs another loop to manage them.
 *	</li>
 *	<li>
 *		Once all the system influences are processed, the engine performs a user-defined reaction to the system influences, as described 
 *		by the {@link ILevel#makeSystemReaction(SimulationTimeStamp, SimulationTimeStamp, ConsistentPublicLocalDynamicState, Collection, boolean, InfluencesMap)}
 *		method.
