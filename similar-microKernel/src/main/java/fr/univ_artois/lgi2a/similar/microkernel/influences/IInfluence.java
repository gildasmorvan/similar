/**
 * Models an influence produced by the agents, the environment or the reaction to modify the dynamic state of the simulation.
 * <p>
 * 	An influence is characterized by a category, telling which kind of influence it models. This category is especially used during
 * 	the reaction phase to identify which type of influence it is, without having to perform a class test (<code>instanceof</code>).
 * </p>
 * 
 * <h1>Correspondence with theory</h1>
 * <p>
 * 	An instance of this class models an influence i&isin;&#x1D540;.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <h1>Usage</h1>
 * <p>
 * 	To facilitate the use of influences, it is advised to define a public and static field defining the category of the influence.
 * 	This way, there won't be any misspelling  during the reaction phase of the simulation, when these categories are 
 * 	used to identify the influences.
